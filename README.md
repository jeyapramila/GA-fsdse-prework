Welcome! Congratulations on your acceptance to GreyAtom's FSDSE Program. We hope you are really excited!! We want you to get ready for the Program and have a smooth experience. This means there is some work to be done before the start of the program.

# Overview

This guide covers the following steps that you need to go through to prepare for the class.

* Setting up your operating system
* Setting up the version control system
* Pre-Reading Material
* Community and Meetups

The material in the *Pre-Reading Material* section is optional, but highly recommended.


# Setting up your operating system
* Minimum system requirements for the laptop to be used during the course - 64 bit system, minimum 4 GB RAM, i3 and above processor

* You can use either the Mac OS or Ubuntu 16.04 while working through the program.
* A note on hardware: your machine should have the `amd64` architecture. If you are not using an ancient machine, you should be fine.

## Mac OS

We'll be using `Homebrew` to install and manage packages.

* [Install `xcode` using this guide](https://www.howtogeek.com/211541/homebrew-for-os-x-easily-installs-desktop-apps-and-terminal-utilities/)
* [Install `brew` using this guide](https://brew.sh/)

## Ubuntu 16.04

You are already using Ubuntu? Just make sure you are using 16.04 LTS and you are all set.

## If you have Windows

You can follow any one of the following strategies:

1. Erase everything and install Ubuntu 16.04 to replace Windows

    - https://www.ubuntu.com/download/desktop/install-ubuntu-desktop
    - https://help.ubuntu.com/lts/installation-guide/amd64/index.html
2. Setup Dual-Boot (you'll have both Windows and Ubuntu 16.04 in your machine)
    - Make sure you have someone experienced to assist you

    - https://askubuntu.com/questions/221835/installing-ubuntu-alongside-a-pre-installed-windows-with-uefi

Using VMWare to run Ubuntu 16.04 from inside of Windows is **not recommended**.

In case you are new to Ubuntu, [here is a guide](http://www.omgubuntu.co.uk/2016/04/10-things-to-do-after-installing-ubuntu-16-04-lts) to get started.Installation related help available on [Ubuntu Forums](https://ubuntuforums.org/) and [StackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/)

# Setting up Version Controlling System (Git and GitHub)

* Install [Git](http://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git) and create a [GitHub](https://github.com/) account.
* [Hands on Introduction to using Git and GitHub](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL5-da3qGB5IBLMp7LtN8Nc3Efd4hJq0kD), video series (27 minutes)

Two companion blog posts:
* [Simple guide to forks](http://www.dataschool.io/simple-guide-to-forks-in-github-and-git/)
* [Git quick reference for beginners](http://www.dataschool.io/git-quick-reference-for-beginners/).

# Pre-Reading Material

* [Analyzing the Analyzers](http://cdn.oreillystatic.com/oreilly/radarreport/0636920029014/Analyzing_the_Analyzers.pdf):An Introspective Survey of Data Scientists and Their Work
 * [A Visual Introduction to Basic Statistics and Probability](http://students.brown.edu/seeing-theory/)
* Read the first two chapters of [The Data Science Handbook](http://www.thedatasciencehandbook.com/get-the-book)

* [Python Code Academy Course](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/python) An interactive, in-browser tutorial from Codecademy with 20+ modules and 200+ exercises. It is geared toward novice programmers. We want you to complete first 25 assignments here.
* [Khan Academy: Probability & Statistics](https://www.khanacademy.org/math/probability)
## Blogs to Follow

We will share many more, when in the course, but here are some very good starting points

## GreyAtom's Philosophy on Learning

* Learning is Organic – It grows. Just like a child. You can’t accelerate the years. Accept it.
* Principal of Necessary Chaos – Chaos is part of learning. Get comfortable with it. Your objective over lifetime is to minimize the chaos.
* Mathematics is the Only Language – You cannot escape Mathematics. Not liking Mathematics is akin to not liking Oxygen.
* To really master any subject, know the philosophy behind it.
* Inflection Point is “Point of Sustainable Practice” – This is the hardest part. Once you reach here. You can drive wherever. Till such time, struggle is inevitable.
* Be hands-on, practice daily – Common sense, isn’t it?
